## Facebook Asynchronous Python SDK

This is the first Python Facebook SDK after Facebook decided to drop the Python port for their API.
I have spent a lot of hours developing Facebook applications in PHP using Facebook's PHP SDK, but recently I decided to move to Python using the Tornado Web Server.

What are the benefits?
- Asynchronous Facebook API calls (which are not possible with Facebook's PHP SDK)
- A lot faster background scripts utilizing Facebook API
- Made to work perfectly with FriendFeed's web server - Tornado Web Server (http://www.tornadoweb.org/)

## Required Packages
